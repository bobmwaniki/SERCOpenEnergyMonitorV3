# SERC Energy Monitor Android App
### Introduction
The SERC Energy monitoring app is a companion Android app for the [Emoncms](https://emoncms.org/) platform (which is part of the [OpenEnergyMonitor](https://openenergymonitor.org/) project) for [Strathmore Energy Research Center](https://serc.strathmore.edu/). The app is partly based on [this tutorial](https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/electricity-monitoring/other-software/AndroidAppPart1) on the OpenEnergyMonitoring website. 

Emoncms is an open-source web application for processing, logging and visualising energy, temperature and other environmental data and is part of the OpenEnergyMonitor project. OpenEnergyMonitor is a project to develop open-source energy monitoring tools to help us relate to our use of energy, our energy systems and the challenge of sustainable energy.

The app can also be downloaded directly from the Play Store
